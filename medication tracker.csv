Avoid if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a dangerous complication of diabetes), or any other type of severe metabolic acidosis.
Not suitable for people with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes).
Should not be used if you have ever had lactic acidosis.
Avoid if you drink excessive amounts of alcohol regularly.
Should not be taken during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
Avoid if you are very dehydrated, severely ill, have had major surgery, or are recovering from trauma or infection.
Not safe if you have conditions causing low oxygen levels in the body (such as severe heart or lung problems, shock, or cardiovascular collapse).
Should not be used before or after certain X-ray or CT scans with contrast dye unless your doctor says it’s safe.
There may be serious drug interactions; always check with your doctor or pharmacist before combining with other medicines.
use with caution:
Before bariatric (weight-loss) surgery, the reason for taking metformin, symptoms, and treatment goals should be documented to allow postsurgical evaluation.
After bariatric surgery, diabetes is usually managed with medications such as DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 inhibitors, insulin, or metformin.
The risk of serious lactic acidosis with metformin after bariatric surgery is considered minimal unless other risk factors, such as kidney problems, are present.
Continued efficacy and tolerability of metformin should be monitored after surgery, and a switch to another medication may be considered if the condition worsens.
In patients with stable heart failure, metformin may be used, but caution is advised in cases of low blood flow.
In patients with liver problems, metformin should be used cautiously, particularly at higher doses or in severe liver disease, as rare cases of liver damage and increased risk of complications have been reported.
When kidney function is reduced, dose adjustments of metformin may be required.
During stressful conditions such as fever, infection, surgery, or trauma, metformin may need to be temporarily discontinued, and insulin may be administered to manage blood sugar safely.
contact your physician if any of the following happened:
Unusual tiredness, muscle pain, trouble breathing, extreme sleepiness, stomach pain, feeling very cold, low blood pressure, or slow/irregular heartbeat — this may mean a rare but serious reaction called lactic acidosis and needs emergency care (lactic acidosis).
Yellowing of the skin or eyes, dark urine, severe tiredness, or unexplained stomach pain — may mean liver problems and needs medical tests and possible change of treatment.
Severe or ongoing diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain that does not get better after a few weeks — may require dose adjustment or stopping the medication.
Feeling weak, pale skin, tingling or numbness in hands or feet, or trouble remembering things — can happen with long-term use due to low vitamin B12, your doctor may need to check your levels.
Rash, swelling, fever, skin changes, or other unusual reactions such as severe tiredness — may mean a serious allergic reaction and requires stopping the medicine and getting medical help right away."

 use is not recommended in cases of diabetic coma, serious infections, trauma, surgery, liver or kidney problems, pregnancy, or breastfeeding.
In some countries, use is not recommended in people with porphyria (a rare blood disorder).
use with caution in:
After bariatric surgery, immediate-release (IR) medicines are usually preferred, since extended-release (ER) ones may not be absorbed well.
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may occur after gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric band. Medicines that do not lower blood sugar too much may be safer.
Insulin production and sensitivity may improve after surgery, especially with gastric bypass, followed by sleeve, and then band. These benefits may start soon after surgery and continue to improve over months.
Weight gain may still happen after surgery, so the benefits and risks of treatment should be reviewed.
People with a condition called G6PD deficiency may be at higher risk for a type of anemia caused by glyburide. Rarely, this can also happen in people without this condition.
In kidney disease, glyburide may build up in the body and cause low blood sugar that lasts a long time. For this reason, its use is usually not recommended in chronic kidney disease.
During times of illness, infection, fever, trauma, or surgery, treatment may need to be stopped and insulin may be used instead.
contact your physician if any of these happened : 
Very low blood sugar, which may cause shakiness, sweating, dizziness, or confusion
Low salt levels in the blood, which may cause weakness, headache, or nausea
Breaking down of red blood cells, which may lead to tiredness or pale skin
Yellowing of the skin or eyes caused by liver or bile problems
Serious liver problems, which can include liver failure
Inflammation of the liver, which may cause fatigue, stomach pain, or dark urine
Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, which can make breathing difficult

It should not be used in people with type 1 diabetes.
It should not be used in people who have diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition caused by very high blood sugar, with or without coma).
Although the package information says it should not be used in people allergic to sulfa drugs, experts believe the risk of cross-allergy may not be as strong as once thought
use with 
use with caution:
Before surgery, the reason for using the medicine, current symptoms, and treatment goals should be recorded so that progress can be checked after surgery.
Right after surgery, low blood sugar may occur, especially as the body starts making and using insulin more effectively.
After surgery, medicines such as DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, insulin, and metformin are usually preferred for blood sugar control.
Sulfonylureas are generally avoided after surgery because of the risk of low blood sugar and possible weight gain.
The medicine should be monitored after surgery to make sure it is still effective and well-tolerated, and it may need to be changed if the condition worsens.
In people with G6PD deficiency, a higher risk of a type of anemia (caused by breakdown of red blood cells) may be present. This reaction has also rarely been seen in people without G6PD deficiency. Alternatives may be considered in such cases.
Caution should be taken if liver problems are present.
should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the expected delivery date.
Caution should be taken if kidney problems are present.
The medicine may need to be stopped and insulin used instead during times of stress such as fever, serious infection, injury, or surgery.

use with caution:
Before weight loss surgery, reasons for taking the medicine, current symptoms, and treatment goals should be recorded so they can be checked again after surgery.
After weight loss surgery, medicines such as metformin, insulin, or other newer diabetes medicines are usually preferred over sulfonylureas, because they may work better and cause fewer problems like low blood sugar or weight gain.
In a study, sitagliptin was found to be safe and helpful in lowering blood sugar after meals in some people who had gastric bypass surgery and still had type 2 diabetes.
After surgery, blood sugar and response to medicines should be closely monitored. If the condition worsens, a switch to another medicine may be needed.
If kidney function is reduced (moderate to severe kidney disease or kidney failure needing dialysis), this medicine should be used with caution, and the dose may need to be adjusted.
contact your physician if any of these happened:
Severe joint pain (arthralgia): May be disabling and involve inflammatory joint conditions. Symptoms usually improve after stopping the drug but may recur if restarted.
Severe skin reactions: Including bullous pemphigoid (blistering skin condition), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). These may require urgent medical attention.
Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis and angioedema (swelling of face, throat, or mouth) can occur, sometimes quickly after starting treatment.
Pancreatic problems: Acute pancreatitis, including severe forms like hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and rarely pancreatic cancer. Symptoms like severe abdominal pain warrant immediate medical evaluation.

Metoclopramide should not be taken by individuals who are allergic to it or any of its ingredients, as allergic reactions such as swelling of the throat or tongue and difficulty breathing may occur.
The use of metoclopramide should be avoided in cases of blockage, tear, or bleeding in the tomach or intestines, except when it is administered prior to a special test for upper stomach bleeding.
Metoclopramide must not be used in patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma or other tumors that secrete adrenaline-like chemicals.
Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of seizures, such as epilepsy, as metoclopramide may not be considered safe in these cases.
Previous episodes of abnormal movements or muscle spasms caused by metoclopramide should lead to avoidance of the medication.
Concomitant use with other medications that increase the risk of movement-related side effects is not recommended.
Due to significant drug interactions, other medications should be carefully reviewed by a healthcare provider before metoclopramide is prescribed.
administration of metoclopramide to infants under 1 year of age is not permitted.
use with caution:
Cancer (like breast cancer): Metoclopramide can raise levels of a hormone called prolactin. It’s not fully clear how this might affect breast cancer or other cancers sensitive to hormones. If you’ve had these types of cancer, please talk to your doctor before using this medicine.
Swelling or fluid buildup (such as from heart or liver problems): This medicine can cause your body to hold onto extra fluid, which might make conditions like heart failure or liver disease worse. If you already have swelling or fluid retention, your doctor will need to keep a close eye on you while you take metoclopramide.
